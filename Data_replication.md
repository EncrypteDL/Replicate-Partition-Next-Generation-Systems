# Overview of Data Replication

In distributed systems, data replication is crucial for ensuring consistency, availability, and fault tolerance. Below are explanations of various patterns and concepts related to data replication:

### Write-Ahead Log

A **write-ahead log (WAL)** is a technique where changes are first written to a log before being applied to the main data storage. This ensures that if a system crashes, the log can be replayed to restore the data to a consistent state.

### HeartBeat

A **heartbeat** is a signal sent at regular intervals between nodes in a distributed system to indicate that they are operational and responsive. It helps in detecting node failures and maintaining system health.

### Generation Clock

A **generation clock** is a logical clock mechanism used to order events in a distributed system. Each event is tagged with a generation number that helps in determining the causal relationships between events.

### Idempotent Receiver

An **idempotent receiver** is designed to handle repeated delivery of the same message without causing unintended effects. This ensures that even if a message is delivered multiple times, the system's state remains consistent.

### Segmented Log

A **segmented log** is a method of organizing a log into multiple segments. Each segment can be independently replicated and managed, improving scalability and fault tolerance by isolating log segments.

### Paxos

**Paxos** is a consensus algorithm used in distributed systems to achieve agreement on a single value among distributed nodes. It ensures consistency despite failures and is fundamental to ensuring replicated state machine consistency.

### High-Water Mark

A **high-water mark** is a point in a log that indicates the latest confirmed and stable state of replicated data. Data up to the high-water mark is considered durable and consistent across replicas.

### Follower Reads

**Follower reads** refer to the practice of allowing read operations to be performed on follower nodes in a replication setup. This can help distribute the read load and improve system performance.

### Low-Water Mark (in progress)

A **low-water mark** indicates the oldest point in the log that can be safely discarded. It represents the earliest state that all nodes in a distributed system are guaranteed to have seen and acknowledged.

### Replicated Log

A **replicated log** is a sequence of records that is consistently replicated across multiple nodes. Each node maintains a copy of the log, ensuring high availability and durability of data.

### Singular Update Queue

A **singular update queue** is a queue that serializes updates to ensure that changes are applied in a specific, consistent order. This helps in maintaining data consistency across replicas.

### Versioned Value

A **versioned value** stores multiple versions of a data item, each tagged with a unique version number. This allows systems to manage updates and resolve conflicts by comparing version numbers.

### Leader and Followers

In a **leader and followers** replication model, one node acts as the leader and is responsible for coordinating updates. The followers replicate the leader's state, ensuring consistency and availability.

### Quorum

A **quorum** is a majority subset of nodes required to agree on an operation in a distributed system. It ensures that a sufficient number of nodes have acknowledged an operation, making it durable and consistent.

### Request Waiting List

A **request waiting list** is a queue of pending requests that are waiting to be processed or acknowledged. It ensures that requests are handled in the correct order and provides a mechanism for retrying failed operations.

### Version Vector

A **version vector** is a mechanism for tracking the version history of replicated data across multiple nodes. Each node maintains a vector of counters, one for each replica, to keep track of updates and resolve conflicts.
