## Why Distributed systems 

A distributed system is essentially a collection of independent computers working together over a network to achieve a common goal. These individual computers, also known as nodes, communicate and share resources to appear as a single unit to the end-user.

In the realm of distributed systems,  "Patterns & Algorithms of Distributed Systems" refers to a collection of recurring solutions to common problems that arise when designing and building these systems.

There are several compelling reasons why distributed systems are becoming increasingly important and widely adopted:

**Scalability:**

- **Handling Increased Demands:** A single server has limitations in terms of processing power, memory, and storage. Distributed systems allow you to add more machines (nodes) to the system as needed. This horizontal scaling helps the system handle growing workloads, increased user bases, and larger data volumes.

**Availability:**

- **Reduced Downtime:** A single point of failure can bring down an entire system. Distributed systems often incorporate redundancy measures. If one node fails, other nodes can take over its tasks, minimizing downtime and improving overall system availability.

**Performance:**

- **Improved Efficiency:** By distributing workloads across multiple machines, distributed systems can process tasks faster and more efficiently. This can lead to quicker response times and better overall system performance.

**Fault Tolerance:**

- **Enhanced Resilience:** Redundancy in distributed systems helps the system tolerate failures. If one node encounters an issue, the system can continue functioning with minimal disruption. This fault tolerance ensures the system is more robust and reliable.

**Flexibility:**

- **Modular Design:** Distributed systems are often designed with modularity in mind. This allows you to easily add new features or functionalities by incorporating additional nodes without affecting the entire system. This makes them adaptable to changing needs.
